### Background

With the rising of chronic diseases, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, LDL-cholesterol, and poor bone health, consumers are looking for food rich in some nutrients or compounds to prevent them.  
Some of my friends and family usually ask me: which food is rich in calcium or iron? because I need more of these. I don’t always remember the food content that’s why I created this small dataviz. So, my goal here is to show to a consumer a list of foods rich in some nutrients like fiber, iron.
