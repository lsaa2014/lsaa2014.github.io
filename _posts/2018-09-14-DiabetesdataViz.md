Below we can see the correlation between Bmi and others variable (age, plasma glucose concentration, Diastolic blood pressure, Triceps skin fold thickness and Diabetes pedigree function). 
- Correlation between Bmi and Triceps skin fold thickness is stronger for those who tested negative
- As Bmi increased Triceps skin fold thickness increased also
- Correlation between Bmi and Age seemed negative for positive test
- With average Bmi more than 34, we found many positive and specially after more than 13 time of pregnant  
- With pedigree function more than 1.8 it is most likely that the test be positive
