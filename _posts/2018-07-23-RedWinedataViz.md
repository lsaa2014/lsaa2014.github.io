Below we can see the correlation between pH/citric, sulphates/chlorides, pH/quality and alcohol/ quality on red wine. 
- Correlation between pH and citric acid is stronger for high quality wine
- As the quality decreased correlation between suphates and chlorides decreased also
- High and medium wine have low pH
- The average alcohol percentage of high quality wine is 11.5.
