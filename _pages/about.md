I'm a Food Scientist phD turned Data Scientist. Passionate of Science.      
I'm interested in exploratory analysis, statistics, machine learning and data visualization.       
I use R mainly for data exploratory analysis and Python for machine learning. I also use SQL even though rarely.     
For data visualization, I prefer Bokeh and Tableau.         
Most of my projects are about food and health as there are my main topics.         
In this blog, I will show some of the analyses I have been doing with food/health data sets.
